fix: Add comprehensive error handling to dashboard

Resolves: Dashboard Internal Server Error when accessing /en/dashboard

## Problem
Users were experiencing "Internal Server Error" when accessing the dashboard
after login. The page would crash instead of gracefully handling API failures.

## Root Cause
1. Dashboard widgets (MyTasksWidget, AtRiskWidget) had no error handling
2. No React error boundaries to catch rendering errors
3. Silent failures caused entire dashboard to crash
4. No error logging to identify failing API calls

## Solution

### Added Error Boundary Infrastructure
- Created ErrorBoundary component to catch React rendering errors
- Created WidgetErrorBoundary for individual dashboard widgets
- Prevents entire page from crashing when a widget fails

### Enhanced Dashboard Widgets
- MyTasksWidget: Added error state handling and user-friendly messages
- AtRiskWidget: Added error state handling and user-friendly messages
- Both widgets now degrade gracefully when API calls fail

### Protected Admin Layout
- Wrapped admin layout with error boundaries
- Added nested error boundary around page content
- Two-layer protection against rendering errors

### Made Dashboard Resilient
- Wrapped all dashboard widgets with WidgetErrorBoundary
- Each widget can fail independently
- Dashboard partially renders even if some sections fail

### Enhanced Error Logging
- Added global onError handler to React Query client
- Logs detailed error information (name, message, stack trace)
- Helps developers identify failing API calls

## Files Changed
- frontend/src/components/error-boundary.tsx (NEW)
- frontend/src/components/dashboard/my-tasks-widget.tsx
- frontend/src/components/dashboard/at-risk-widget.tsx
- frontend/src/app/[locale]/(admin)/layout.tsx
- frontend/src/app/[locale]/(admin)/dashboard/page.tsx
- frontend/src/lib/query-client.ts

## Testing
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Build completes without errors
- ✅ Error boundaries catch rendering errors
- ✅ Widgets show error states when API fails
- ✅ Console logs detailed error information

## Benefits
- Dashboard always loads (no "Internal Server Error" page)
- Clear error messages instead of blank screens
- Partial functionality when some services fail
- Better debugging with detailed error logs
- Professional error states with retry options
